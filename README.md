**Ostinato has switched to using XDP instead of DPDK for achieving high speeds. See [Ostinato Turbo Transmit](https://ostinato.org/pricing/turbo#performance)**.

# DPDK accelerated Ostinato

:trophy: [Solo Prize Winner - 6WIND Speed Matters: The Challenge Contest](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/08/prweb12120068.htm)

Slide-deck: http://www.slideshare.net/pstavirs/dpdk-accelerated-ostinato

Prototype Implementation to accompany the above slides (code imported from http://code.google.com/r/pstavirs-dpdk/)

This code is unsupported and not maintained. There are other forks of this code that are more recent -
* [PLVision/ostinato-dpdk](https://github.com/PLVision/ostinato-dpdk)
* [dancollins/ostinato](https://github.com/dancollins/ostinato)

However, the above forks also don't seem to be maintained and supported (to the best of my knowledge).

~~If you would like to take this prototype implementation ahead and are willing to maintain and support it going forward, I (as the Ostinato lead developer) will work with you to put in a plugin framework where the DPDK implementation can be added as a plugin that can be developed and maintained separately from the main project.~~

~~Contact me if you are interested.~~
